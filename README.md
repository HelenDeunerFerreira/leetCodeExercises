## 234. Palindrome Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

The solution is at palindrome-linked-list.py

## 383. Ransom Note

Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.
Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

The solution is at ransom-note.py

## 1672. Richest Customer Wealth

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

The solution is at richest-costumer-wealth.py

## 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

The solution is at number-steps-number-zero.py

## 13. Roman to Integer

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

The solution is at roman-to-integer.py

## 412. Fizz Buzz

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

The solution is at fizzbuzz.py

## 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix

You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear to the left of all the 0's in each row.
A row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:
The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i < j.
Return the indices of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.

The solution is at k-weakest.py

## 876. Middle of the Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

The solution is at middle-linked-list.py

## 1. Two Sum (NOT COMPLETE YET)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

The solution is at two-sum.py
